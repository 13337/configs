# configs

i3config should be placed at ~/.config/i3/config

i3statusconfig should be placed at ~/.config/i3status/config

tux.jpg was yoinked from GIS results for "tux wallpaper" and was initially at http://p1.pichost.me/i/68/1930613.jpg and it should placed ~/Pictures/tux.jpg (if you have xdg_user_dirs or whatever. Otherwise put it where you want and edit the appropriate line in ~/.config/i3/config)
